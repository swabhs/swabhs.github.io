<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), where I lead the [DILL Lab ðŸŒ¿](https://dill-lab.github.io/).
My research interests lie in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, where I study language generation and generative evaluation, from a data-centric perspective.
I am newly appointed as an Associate Director of the [USC Center for AI and Society](https://cais.usc.edu/), where I additionally explore the impacts of language technologies on societal problems.
<!-- My research interests broadly span Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, where I study the [estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08420) of [dataset quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795), the [(semi-)automatic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05955) collection of impactful data, as well as [evaluating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01454) how human biases [affect dataset construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07997) and model decisions. -->
<!-- via the [discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01378) of [undesirable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00086) [biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324), including [social biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07997). The ultimate goal is advancing generalization not only via [bias reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108), but also via careful data curation, and [evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01454). -->


Previously, I was a postdoctoral investigator at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).
I obtained my [PhD](/assets/pdf/swabha_thesis.pdf) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://lti.cmu.edu/people/alumni/alumni-2019/swayamdipta-swabha.html), advised by [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Chris Dyer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/).
During most of my PhD I was a visiting student at [UW](https://www.cs.washington.edu/).
I earned my MS from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), and my bachelors from [NIT Calicut](https://minerva.nitc.ac.in/) in India.
