This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model’s system message. We propose a new method – prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) – that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model’s next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2–3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5–27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">CoLM</abbr> </div> <div id="wang2025teachingmodelsunderstandbut" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03052" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Teaching Models to Understand (but not Generate) High-risk Data</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Ryan Wang , Matthew Finlayson , Luca Soldaini , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, and Robin Jia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Conference on Language Modeling</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanyxw/llm-decouple" class="abstract badge" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:cadetblue">Code</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Language model developers typically filter out high-risk content – such as toxic or copyrighted text – from their pre-training data to prevent models from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits models’ ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the model’s context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content. Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models’ understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content) without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall, our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would otherwise be filtered out.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">CoLM</abbr> </div> <div id="ghosh2025congrs" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03527" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Sample, Align, Synthesize: Graph-Based Response Synthesis with CONGRS</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Sayan Ghosh , Shahzaib Saqib Warraich , Dhruv Tarsadiya , Gregory Yauney , and <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>COLM Workshop on Test-time Scaling and Reasoning Models (ScaLR@COLM) / NeurIPS Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/dill-lab/sample-fusion-with-congrs" class="abstract badge" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:cadetblue">Code</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Inference-time scaling methods improve language model performance, but existing methods lack the flexibility to synthesize information across multiple long-form generation samples. We introduce Consensus Graphs (CONGRS), a flexible DAG-based data structure that represents shared content and semantic variation across a set of LM responses to the same prompt. Constructing CONGRS relies on lightweight lexical multiple sequence alignment supplemented by targeted usage of a secondary LM judge, which reduces reliance on LM judges by more than 80% compared to other methods. Our experiments show that synthesizing responses from CONGRS improves factual precision on a biography generation task by up to 32% over an average response. We apply our approach to the MATH and AIME reasoning tasks and find an improvement over self-verification and majority vote baselines by up to 6 points of accuracy.

We consider the task of text simplification, commonly used to improve information accessibility, where evaluation faces two major challenges. First, the data in existing benchmarks might not reflect the capabilities of current language models on the task, often containing disfluent, incoherent, or simplistic examples. Second, existing human ratings associated with the benchmarks often contain a high degree of disagreement, resulting in inconsistent ratings; nevertheless, existing metrics still have to show higher correlations with these imperfect ratings. As a result, evaluation for the task is not reliable and does not reflect expected trends (e.g., more powerful models being assigned higher scores). We address these challenges for the task of text simplification through three contributions. First, we introduce SynthSimpliEval, a synthetic benchmark for text simplification featuring simplified sentences generated by models of varying sizes. Through a pilot study, we show that human ratings on our benchmark exhibit high inter-annotator agreement and reflect the expected trend: larger models produce higher-quality simplifications. Second, we show that auto-evaluation with a panel of LLM judges (LLMs-as-a-jury) often suffices to obtain consistent ratings for the evaluation of text simplification. Third, we demonstrate that existing learnable metrics for text simplification benefit from training on our LLMs-as-a-jury-rated synthetic data, closing the gap with pure LLMs-as-a-jury for evaluation. Overall, through our case study on text simplification, we show that a reliable evaluation requires higher quality test data, which could be obtained through synthetic data and LLMs-as-a-jury ratings.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NeurIPS</abbr> </div> <div id="ranjit2025nvdrs" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18541" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Designing and Validating Intervention Opportunities for Suicide Prevention with Language Model Assistants</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Jaspreet Ranjit , Hyundong J.

In a demanding public health data pipeline, annotators manually extract structured information from death investigation records following extensive guidelines developed painstakingly by experts. In this work, we facilitate data-driven insights from the NVDRS data to support the development of novel suicide interventions by investigating the value of language models (LMs) as efficient assistants to these (a) data annotators and (b) experts. We find that LM predictions match existing data annotations about 85% of the time across 50 NVDRS variables. In the cases where the LM disagrees with existing annotations, expert review reveals that LM assistants can surface annotation discrepancies 38% of the time. Finally, we introduce a human-in-the-loop algorithm to assist experts in efficiently building and refining guidelines for annotating new variables by allowing them to focus only on providing feedback for incorrect LM predictions. We apply our algorithm to a real-world case study for a new variable that characterizes victim interactions with lawyers and demonstrate that it achieves comparable annotation quality with a laborious manual approach. Our findings provide evidence that LMs can serve as effective assistants to public health researchers who handle sensitive data in high-stakes scenarios.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NeurIPS</abbr> </div> <div id="surana2025chemref" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="./" target="_blank"><b>ChEmREF: Evaluating Language Model Readiness for Chemical Emergency Response Assistance</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Risha Surana , Qinyuan Ye , and <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>NeurIPS Workshop on LLM Evaluation</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">arXiv</abbr> </div> <div id="he2025believingseeingqualityscores" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25844" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Believing without Seeing: Quality Scores for Contextualizing Vision-Language Model Explanations</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Keyu He , Tejas Srinivasan , Brihi Joshi , Xiang Ren , Jesse Thomason , and <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Under Review</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EMNLP</abbr> </div> <div id="kulkarni2025evaluatingevaluationmetrics" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18114" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Evaluating Evaluation Metrics – The Mirage of Hallucination Detection</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Atharva Kulkarni , Yuan Zhang , Joel Ruben Antony Moniz , Xiou Ge , Bo-Hsiang Tseng , Dhivya Piraviperumal , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, and Hong Yu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Findings of EMNLP</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EMNLP</abbr> </div> <div id="joshi2025pbnj" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17993" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Improving LLM Personas via Rationalization with Psychological Scaffolds</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Brihi Joshi , Xiang Ren , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski , and Tim Paek </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Findings of EMNLP</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Language models prompted with a user description or persona can predict a user’s preferences and opinions, but existing approaches to building personas – based solely on a user’s demographic attributes and/or prior judgments – fail to capture the underlying reasoning behind said user judgments.

These rationales are LLM-generated, and aim to reason about a user’s behavior on the basis of their experiences, personality traits or beliefs. This is done using psychological scaffolds – structured frameworks grounded in theories such as the Big 5 Personality Traits and Primal World Beliefs – that help provide structure to the generated rationales. Experiments on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate that LLM personas augmented with PB&amp;J rationales consistently outperform methods using only a user’s demographics and/or judgments.

Previous data watermarking techniques primarily focus on effective memorization after pretraining, while overlooking challenges that arise in other stages of the LLM pipeline, such as the risk of watermark filtering during data preprocessing, or potential forgetting through post-training, or verification difficulties due to API-only access. We propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects coherent and plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated attributes. Our watermarks are designed to be memorized by the LLM through seamlessly integrating in its training data, making them harder to detect lexically during preprocessing. We demonstrate that our watermarks can be effectively memorized by LLMs, and that increasing our watermarks’ density, length, and diversity of attributes strengthens their memorization. We further show that our watermarks remain robust throughout LLM development, maintaining their effectiveness after continual pretraining and supervised finetuning.

To this end, we introduce ELI-Why, a benchmark of 13.4K "Why" questions to evaluate the pedagogical capabilities of language models. We then conduct two extensive human studies to assess the utility of language model-generated explanatory answers (explanations) on our benchmark, tailored to three distinct educational grades: elementary, high-school and graduate school. In our first study, human raters assume the role of an "educator" to assess model explanations’ fit to different educational grades. We find that GPT-4-generated explanations match their intended educational background only 50% of the time, compared to 79% for lay human-curated explanations. In our second study, human raters assume the role of a learner to assess if an explanation fits their own informational needs. Across all educational backgrounds, users deemed GPT-4-generated explanations 20% less suited on average to their informational needs, when compared to explanations curated by lay people. Additionally, automated evaluation metrics reveal that explanations generated across different language model families for different informational needs remain indistinguishable in their grade-level, limiting their pedagogical effectiveness.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">arXiv</abbr> </div> <div id="huang2025trustworthinessgenerativefoundationmodels" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14296" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>On the Trustworthiness of Generative Foundation Models: Guideline, Assessment, and Perspective</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Yue Huang , Chujie Gao , Siyuan Wu , Haoran Wang , Xiangqi Wang , Yujun Zhou , Yanbo Wang , Jiayi Ye , Jiawen Shi , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 57 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '57 more authors' ?

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components–metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation–to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges.

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we–a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science–present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EMNLP</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/separability-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/separability-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/separability-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/separability.jpeg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="separability.jpeg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="ghosh2024compare" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01878" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Compare without Despair: Reliable Preference Evaluation with Generation Separability</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Sayan Ghosh , Tejas Srinivasan , and <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Findings of EMNLP</em> , 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/dill-lab/separability" class="abstract badge" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:cadetblue">Code</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Human evaluation of generated language through pairwise preference judgments is pervasive. However, under common scenarios, such as when generations from a model pair are very similar, or when stochastic decoding results in large variations in generations, it results in inconsistent preference ratings. We address these challenges by introducing a meta-evaluation measure, separability, which estimates how suitable a test instance is for pairwise preference evaluation. For a candidate test instance, separability samples multiple generations from a pair of models, and measures how distinguishable the two sets of generations are. Our experiments show that instances with high separability values yield more consistent preference ratings from both human- and auto-raters. Further, the distribution of separability allows insights into which test benchmarks are more valuable for comparing models. Finally, we incorporate separability into ELO ratings, accounting for how suitable each test instance might be for reliably ranking LLMs. Overall, separability has implications for consistent, efficient and robust preference evaluation of LLMs with both human- and auto-raters.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EMNLP</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/oath_frames-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/oath_frames-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/oath_frames-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/oath_frames.jpeg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="oath_frames.jpeg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="ranjit2024oath" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14883" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>OATH-Frames: Characterizing Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness via LLM Assistants</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Jaspreet Ranjit , Brihi Joshi , Rebecca Dorn , Laura Petry , Olga Koumoundouros , Jayne Bottarini , Peichen Liu , Eric Rice , and <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of EMNLP</em> , 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> <a href="https://dill-lab.github.io/oath-frames/" class="abstract badge" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:cadetblue">Blog</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/dill-lab/oath-frames" class="abstract badge" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:cadetblue">Code</span></a> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);font-weight:bold">Outstanding Paper Award @ EMNLP’24; Best Poster Award @ ShowCAIS’24</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Homelessness in the U.S. is widespread; individual beliefs and attitudes towards homelessness—often expressed on social media are complex and nuanced (e.g. critical as well as sympathetic). Such attitudes can be challenging to summarize at scale, obfuscating the broader public opinion which advocacy organizations use to guide public policy and reform efforts. Our work proposes an approach to enable a large-scale study on homelessness via two major contributions. First, with the help of domain experts in social work and their trainees, we characterize Online Attitudes towards Homelessness in nine hierarchical frames (OATH-Frames) on a collection of 4K social media posts. Further, in an effort to ease the annotation of these frames, we employ GPT-4 as an LLM assistant to the experts; GPT-4 + Expert annotation presents an attractive trade off owing to a 6.5× speedup in annotation time despite only incurring a 2 point F1 difference in annotation performance. Our effort results in a collection of 8K social media posts labeled by domain and trained experts (with and without GPT-4 assistance). Second, using predicted OATH-Frames on a Flan-T5-Large model trained on our data, we perform a large-scale analysis on 2.4M posts on homelessness. We find that posts that contain mentions of west coast states express more harmful generalizations of people experiencing homelessness (PEH) compared to posts about east coast states. We also find marked differences in attitudes across vulnerable populations as they are compared to PEH as being either more or less deserving of aid.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EMNLP</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/nnk-means-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/nnk-means-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/nnk-means-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/nnk-means.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="nnk-means.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="gulati2024out" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13141" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Out-of-Distribution Detection through Soft Clustering with Non-Negative Kernel Regression</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Aryan Gulati , Xingjian Dong , Carlos Hurtado , Sarath Shekkizhar , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, and Antonio Ortega </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Findings of EMNLP</em> , 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/STAC-USC/NNK-Means-OOD" class="abstract badge" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:cadetblue">Code</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As language models become more general purpose, increased attention needs to be paid to detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, i.e., those not belonging to any of the distributions seen during training.

Our approach greatly reduces computational and space complexities (up to 11\times improvement in inference time and 87% reduction in storage requirements) and outperforms existing approaches by up to 4 AUROC points on four different benchmarks.

In this work, we show that even with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1,000 for OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We show that this lends itself to a model image or a model signature which unlocks several capabilities with affordable cost: efficiently discovering the LLM’s hidden size, obtaining full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ACL</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/generated-fn-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/generated-fn-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/generated-fn-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/generated-fn.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="generated-fn.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="cui2024annotating" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04834" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Annotating FrameNet via Structure-Conditioned Language Generation</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Xinyue Cui , and <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of ACL</em> , 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Despite the mounting evidence for generative capabilities of language models in understanding and generating natural language, their effectiveness on explicit manipulation and generation of linguistic structures remain understudied.

Although they guarantee that when synthesis is successful, the implementation satisfies the specification, they provide no additional information regarding how the implementation works or the manner in which the specification is realized. One possibility to answer these questions is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct human-readable explanations. Unfortunately, experiments reveal that LLMs frequently produce nonsensical or misleading explanations when applied to the unidiomatic code produced by program synthesizers. In this paper, we develop an approach to reliably augment the implementation with explanatory names. We recover fine-grained input-output data from the synthesis algorithm to enhance the prompt supplied to the LLM, and use a combination of a program verifier and a second language model to validate the proposed explanations before presenting them to the user. Together, these techniques massively improve the accuracy of the proposed names, from 24% to 79% respectively. Through a pair of small user studies, we find that users significantly prefer the explanations produced by our technique (76% of responses indicating the appropriateness of the presenting names) to the baseline (with only 2% of responses approving of the suggestions), and that the proposed names measurably help users in understanding the synthesized implementation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EACL</abbr> </div> <div id="vazquez2024proceedings" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.uncertainlp-1.0/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Uncertainty-Aware NLP (UncertaiNLP 2024)</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Raúl Vázquez , Hande Celikkanat , Dennis Ulmer , Jörg Tiedemann , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Wilker Aziz , Barbara Plank , Joris Baan , and Marie-Catherine Marneffe </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Uncertainty-Aware NLP (UncertaiNLP 2024)</em> , 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Human languages are inherently ambiguous and understanding language input is subject to interpretation and complex contextual dependencies.

We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of the truncation sampling by proving that truncation methods that discard tokens below some probability threshold (the most common type of truncation) can guarantee that all sampled tokens have nonzero true probability. However, thresholds are a coarse heuristic, and necessarily discard some tokens with nonzero true probability as well. In pursuit of a more precise sampling strategy, we show that we can leverage a known source of model errors, the softmax bottleneck, to prove that certain tokens have nonzero true probability, without relying on a threshold. Based on our findings, we develop an experimental truncation strategy and the present pilot studies demonstrating the promise of this type of algorithm. Our evaluations show that our method outperforms its threshold-based counterparts under automatic and human evaluation metrics for low-entropy (i.e., close to greedy) open-ended text generation.

However, access to inference API for such models is limited, thereby restricting the scope and the diversity of the knowledge acquisition. We thus ask a seemingly implausible question: whether more accessible, yet considerably smaller and weaker models such as GPT-2, can be utilized to acquire comparative knowledge, such that the resulting quality is on par with their large-scale counterparts? We introduce NeuroComparatives, a novel framework for comparative knowledge distillation using lexically-constrained decoding, followed by stringent filtering of generated knowledge. Our framework acquires comparative knowledge between everyday objects and results in a corpus of 8.7M comparisons over 1.74M entity pairs - 10X larger and 30% more diverse than existing resources. Moreover, human evaluations show that NeuroComparatives outperform existing resources (up to 32% absolute improvement), even including GPT-3, despite using a 100X smaller model.

We characterize ambiguity in a sentence by its effect on entailment relations with another sentence, and collect AmbiEnt, a linguist-annotated benchmark of 1,645 examples with diverse kinds of ambiguity. We design a suite of tests based on AmbiEnt, presenting the first evaluation of pretrained LMs to recognize ambiguity and disentangle possible meanings. We find that the task remains extremely challenging, including for the recent GPT-4, whose generated disambiguations are considered correct only 32% of the time in human evaluation, compared to 90% for disambiguations in our dataset. Finally, to illustrate the value of ambiguity-sensitive tools, we show that a multilabel NLI model can flag political claims in the wild that are misleading due to ambiguity. We encourage the field to rediscover the importance of ambiguity for NLP.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">JMLR</abbr> </div> <div id="pillutla2022mauve" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14578" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>MAUVE Scores for Generative Models: Theory and Practice</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Krishna Pillutla , Lang Liu , John Thickstun , Sean Welleck , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Rowan Zellers , Sewoong Oh , Yejin Choi , and Zaid Harchaoui </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Journal of Machine Learning Research</em> , 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Generative AI has matured to a point where large-scale models can generate text that seems indistinguishable from human-written text and remarkably photorealistic images. Automatically measuring how close the distribution of generated data is to the target real data distribution is a key step in diagnosing existing models and developing better models. We present MAUVE, a family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in generative modeling. We explore four approaches to statistically estimate these scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, classifier-based estimation, and parametric Gaussian approximations. We provide statistical bounds for the vector quantization approach. Empirically, we find that the proposed scores paired with a range of f-divergences and statistical estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of human-written text and those of modern neural language models by correlating with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts. We conclude the paper by demonstrating its applications to other AI domains and discussing practical recommendations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ACL</abbr> </div> <div id="zhou2023cobra" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.392/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>COBRA Frames: Contextual Reasoning about Effects and Harms of Offensive Statements</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Xuhui Zhou , Hao Zhu , Akhila Yerukola , Thomas Davidson , Jena D.

Such contextual factors have been largely ignored by previous approaches to toxic language detection. We introduce COBRA , the first context-aware formalism for explaining the intents, reactions, and harms of offensive or biased statements grounded in their social and situational context. We create COBRACORPUS, a dataset of 33k potentially offensive statements paired with machine-generated contexts and free-text explanations of offensiveness, implied biases, speaker intents, and listener reactions. To study the contextual dynamics of offensiveness, we train models to generate COBRA explanations, with and without access to the context. We find that explanations by context-agnostic models are significantly worse than by context-aware ones, especially in situations where the context inverts the statement’s offensiveness (29% accuracy drop). Our work highlights the importance and feasibility of contextualized NLP by modeling social factors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ACL</abbr> </div> <div id="bhagavatula2022i2d2" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09246" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>I2D2: Inductive Knowledge Distillation with NeuroLogic and Self-Imitation</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Chandra Bhagavatula , Jena D.

And yet, scale appears to be the winning recipe; after all, the largest models seem to have acquired the largest amount of commonsense capabilities. Or is it? In this paper, we investigate the possibility of a seemingly impossible match: can smaller language models with dismal commonsense capabilities (i.e., GPT-2), ever win over models that are orders of magnitude larger and better (i.e., GPT-3), if the smaller models are powered with novel commonsense distillation algorithms? The key intellectual question we ask here is whether it is possible, if at all, to design a learning algorithm that does not benefit from scale, yet leads to a competitive level of commonsense acquisition. In this work, we study the generative models of commonsense knowledge, focusing on the task of generating generics, statements of commonsense facts about everyday concepts, e.g., birds can fly. We introduce a novel commonsense distillation framework, I2D2, that loosely follows the Symbolic Knowledge Distillation of West et al. but breaks the dependence on the extreme-scale models as the teacher model by two innovations: (1) the novel adaptation of NeuroLogic Decoding to enhance the generation quality of the weak, off-the-shelf language models, and (2) self-imitation learning to iteratively learn from the model’s own enhanced commonsense acquisition capabilities. Empirical results suggest that scale is not the only way, as novel algorithms can be a promising alternative. Moreover, our study leads to a new corpus of generics, Gen-A-Tomic, that is of the largest and highest quality available to date.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ACL</abbr> </div> <div id="chen2022rev" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04982" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>REV: Information-Theoretic Evaluation of Free-Text Rationales</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Hanjie Chen , Faeze Brahman , Xiang Ren , Yangfeng Ji , Yejin Choi , and <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proc. of ACL</em> , 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Free-text rationales are a promising step towards explainable AI, yet their evaluation remains an open research problem.

We investigate this research problem from an information-theoretic perspective using the conditional V-information. More concretely, we propose a metric called REV (Rationale Evaluation with conditional V-information), that can quantify the new information in a rationale supporting a given label beyond the information already available in the input or the label. Experiments on reasoning tasks across four benchmarks, including few-shot prompting with GPT-3, demonstrate the effectiveness of REV in evaluating different types of rationale-label pairs, compared to existing metrics. Through several quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate the capability of REV in providing more sensitive measurements of new information in free-text rationales with respect to a label. Furthermore, REV is consistent with human judgments on rationale evaluations. Overall, when used alongside traditional performance metrics, REV provides deeper insights into a models’ reasoning and prediction processes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EMNLP</abbr> </div> <div id="sun2022investigating" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11083" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Investigating the Benefits of Free-Form Rationales</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Jiao Sun , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Jonathan May , and Xuezhe Ma </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Findings of EMNLP</em> , 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/sunjiao123sun/rationale-utility" class="abstract badge" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color:cadetblue">Code</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Free-form rationales aim to aid model interpretability by supplying the background knowledge that can help understand model decisions.

Inspired by this finding, we ask: can the additional context provided by free-form rationales benefit models, similar to human users? We investigate the utility of rationales as an additional source of supervision, by varying the quantity and quality of rationales during training. After controlling for instances where rationales leak the correct answer while not providing additional background knowledge, we find that incorporating only 5% of rationales during training can boost model performance by 47.22% for CoS-E and 57.14% for ECQA during inference.

We introduce a novel paradigm for dataset creation based on human and machine collaboration, which brings together the generative strength of language models and the evaluative strength of humans. Starting with an existing dataset, MultiNLI, our approach uses dataset cartography to automatically identify examples that demonstrate challenging reasoning patterns, and instructs GPT-3 to compose new examples with similar patterns. Machine generated examples are then automatically filtered, and finally revised and labeled by human crowdworkers to ensure quality. The resulting dataset, WANLI, consists of 108,357 natural language inference (NLI) examples that present unique empirical strengths over existing NLI datasets. Remarkably, training a model on WANLI instead of MNLI (which is 4 times larger) improves performance on seven out-of-domain test sets we consider, including by 11% on HANS and 9% on Adversarial NLI. Moreover, combining MNLI with WANLI is more effective than combining with other augmentation sets that have been introduced.

Natural Language Processing is being revolutionized by deep learning. However, deep learning requires large amounts of annotated data, and its advantage over traditional statistical methods typically diminishes when such data is not available. Large amounts of annotated data simply do not exist for many low-resource languages. Even for high-resource languages it can be difficult to find linguistically annotated data of sufficient size and quality to allow neural methods to excel; this remains true even as few-shot learning approaches have gained popularity in recent years. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the NLP and ML communities who work on learning with neural methods when there is not enough data for those methods to succeed out-of-the-box. Specifically, it will provide attendees with an overview of new and existing approaches from various disciplines, and enable them to distill principles that can be more generally applicable. We will also discuss the main challenges arising in this setting, and outline potential directions for future progress. Our program covers a broad spectrum of applications and techniques. It is augmented by invited talks from Yulia Tsvetkov, Sebastian Ruder, Graham Neubig, and David Ifeoluwa Adelani.

We consider the task of generating free-text explanations using a small number of human-written examples (i.e., in a few-shot manner). We find that (1) authoring higher-quality examples for prompting results in higher quality generations; and (2) surprisingly, in a head-to-head comparison, crowdworkers often prefer explanations generated by GPT-3 to crowdsourced human-written explanations contained within existing datasets. Crowdworker ratings also show, however, that while models produce factual, grammatical, and sufficient explanations, they have room to improve, e.g., along axes such as providing novel information and supporting the label. We create a pipeline that combines GPT-3 with a supervised filter that incorporates humans-in-the-loop via binary acceptability judgments. Despite significant subjectivity intrinsic to judging acceptability, our approach is able to consistently filter GPT-3 generated explanations deemed acceptable by humans.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NAACL</abbr> </div> <div id="sap2021annotators" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07997" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Annotators with Attitudes: How Annotator Beliefs And Identities Bias Toxic Language Detection</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Maarten Sap , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Laura Vianna , Xuhui Zhou , Yejin Choi , and Noah A.

We disentangle what is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three characteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect, and vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity and beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative annotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were less likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE as toxic. We additionally present a case study illustrating how a popular toxicity detection system’s ratings inherently reflect only specific beliefs and perspectives.

We propose a data augmentation approach, which uses existing frame-specific annotation to automatically annotate other lexical units of the same frame which are unannotated. Our rule-based approach defines the notion of a sister lexical unit and generates frame-specific augmented data for training. We present experiments on frame-semantic role labeling which demonstrate the importance of this data augmentation: we obtain a large improvement to prior results on frame identification and argument identification for FrameNet, utilizing both full-text and lexicographic annotations under FrameNet.

They are more inherently intuitive to humans to both produce and comprehend. We propose a methodology to produce contrastive explanations for classification models by modifying the representation to disregard non-contrastive information, and modifying model behavior to only be based on contrastive reasoning. Our method is based on projecting model representation to a latent space that captures only the features that are useful (to the model) to differentiate two potential decisions. We demonstrate the value of contrastive explanations by analyzing two different scenarios, using both high-level abstract concept attribution and low-level input token/span attribution, on two widely used text classification tasks.

Intuitively, under the ensemble, tokens only get high probability if they are considered likely by the experts, and unlikely by the anti-experts. We apply DExperts to language detoxification and sentiment-controlled generation, where we outperform existing controllable generation methods on both automatic and human evaluations.

However, the increased emphasis on data quantity has made it challenging to assess the quality of data. We introduce Data Maps—a model-based tool to characterize and diagnose datasets. We leverage a largely ignored source of information: the behavior of the model on individual instances during training (training dynamics) for building data maps. This yields two intuitive measures for each example—the model’s confidence in the true class, and the variability of this confidence across epochs—obtained in a single run of training. Experiments across four datasets show that these model-dependent measures reveal three distinct regions in the data map, each with pronounced characteristics. First, our data maps show the presence of "ambiguous" regions with respect to the model, which contribute the most towards out-of-distribution generalization. Second, the most populous regions in the data are "easy to learn" for the model, and play an important role in model optimization. Finally, data maps uncover a region with instances that the model finds "hard to learn"; these often correspond to labeling errors. Our results indicate that a shift in focus from quantity to quality of data could lead to robust models and improved out-of-distribution generalization.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ACL</abbr> </div> <div id="gururangan2020dont" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10964" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Don’t Stop Pretraining: Adapt Language Models to Domains and Tasks</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Suchin Gururangan , Ana Marasović , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Kyle Lo , Iz Beltagy , Doug Downey , and Noah A.

This raises the question of whether these models have learned to solve a dataset rather than the underlying task by overfitting to spurious dataset biases. We investigate one recently proposed approach, AFLite, which adversarially filters such dataset biases, as a means to mitigate the prevalent overestimation of machine performance. We provide a theoretical understanding for AFLite, by situating it in the generalized framework for optimum bias reduction. We present extensive supporting evidence that AFLite is broadly applicable for reduction of measurable dataset biases, and that models trained on the filtered datasets yield better generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. Finally, filtering results in a large drop in model performance (e.g., from 92% to 62% for SNLI), while human performance still remains high. Our work thus shows that such filtered datasets can pose new research challenges for robust generalization by serving as upgraded benchmarks. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ACL</abbr> </div> <div id="schwartz2020right" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07453" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>The Right Tool for the Job: Matching Model and Instance Complexities</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Roy Schwartz , Gabi Stanovsky , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Jesse Dodge , and Noah A.

To better respect a given inference budget, we propose a modification to contextual representation fine-tuning which, during inference, allows for an early (and fast) "exit" from neural network calculations for simple instances, and late (and accurate) exit for hard instances. To achieve this, we add classifiers to different layers of BERT and use their calibrated confidence scores to make early exit decisions. We test our proposed modification on five different datasets in two tasks: three text classification datasets and two natural language inference benchmarks. Our method presents a favorable speed/accuracy tradeoff in almost all cases, producing models which are up to five times faster than the state of the art, while preserving their accuracy. Our method also requires almost no additional training resources (in either time or parameters) compared to the baseline BERT model. Finally, our method alleviates the need for costly retraining of multiple models at different levels of efficiency; we allow users to control the inference speed/accuracy tradeoff using a single trained model, by setting a single variable at inference time.

We investigate G-DAUG^C, a novel generative data augmentation method that aims to achieve more accurate and robust learning in the low-resource setting. Our approach generates synthetic examples using pretrained language models, and selects the most informative and diverse set of examples for data augmentation. In experiments with multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks, G-DAUG^C consistently outperforms existing data augmentation methods based on back-translation, and establishes a new state-of-the-art on WinoGrande, CODAH, and CommonsenseQA. Further, in addition to improvements in in-distribution accuracy, G-DAUG^C-augmented training also enhances out-of-distribution generalization, showing greater robustness against adversarial or perturbed examples. Our analysis demonstrates that G-DAUG^C produces a diverse set of fluent training examples, and that its selection and training approaches are important for performance.

The underlying syntactic structure of language allows for composition of simple elements into more complex ones in innumerable ways; generalization to new examples hinges on this structure. We define a syntactic inductive bias as a signal that steers the learning algorithm towards a syntactically robust solution, over others. This thesis explores the need for incorporation of such biases into already powerful neural models of language. We describe three general approaches for incorporating syntactic inductive biases into task-specific models, under different levels of supervision. The first method calls for joint learning of entire syntactic dependency trees with semantic dependency graphs through direct supervision, to facilitate better semantic dependency parsing. Second, we introduce the paradigm of scaffolded learning, which enables us to leverage inductive biases from syntactic sources to predict a related semantic structure, using only as much supervision as is necessary. The third approach yields general-purpose contextualized representations conditioned on large amounts of data along with their shallow syntactic structures, obtained automatically. The linguistic representations learned as a result of syntactic inductive biases are shown to be effective across a range of downstream tasks, but their usefulness is especially pronounced for semantic tasks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NAACL</abbr> </div> <div id="Ruder:19" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-5004/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Tutorial on Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Sebastian Ruder , Matthew E Peters , <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, and Thomas Wolf </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proc. of NAACL</em> , Jun 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge" role="button"><span style="color:cadetblue">Abstract</span></a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The classic supervised machine learning paradigm is based on learning in isolation, a single predictive model for a task using a single dataset.

Over the last two years, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed the emergence of several transfer learning methods and architectures which significantly improved upon the state-of-the-art on a wide range of NLP tasks. These improvements together with the wide availability and ease of integration of these methods are reminiscent of the factors that led to the success of pretrained word embeddings and ImageNet pretraining in computer vision, and indicate that these methods will likely become a common tool in the NLP landscape as well as an important research direction.

First, we enhance the ELMo architecture to allow pretraining on predicted shallow syntactic parses, instead of just raw text, so that contextual embeddings make use of shallow syntactic context. Our second method involves shallow syntactic features obtained automatically on downstream task data. Neither approach leads to a significant gain on any of the four downstream tasks we considered relative to ELMo-only baselines. Further analysis using black-box probes confirms that our shallow-syntax-aware contextual embeddings do not transfer to linguistic tasks any more easily than ELMo’s embeddings.

This workshop will present current research on aligning Frame Semantic resources across languages and automatic frame semantic parsing in English and other languages. We will explore the extent to which semantic frames are similar across languages and the implications for theories of semantic universals, the practice of translation (whether human or machine), and multilingual knowledge representation. Does not require prior familiarity with Frame Semantics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">arXiv</abbr> </div> <div id="Neubig:17" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03980" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>DyNet: The Dynamic Neural Network Toolkit</b></a></div> <div class="author"> Graham Neubig , Chris Dyer , Yoav Goldberg , Austin Matthews , Waleed Ammar , Antonios Anastasopoulos , Miguel Ballesteros , David Chiang , Daniel Clothiaux , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 16 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '16 more authors' ?

In the static declaration strategy that is used in toolkits like Theano, CNTK, and TensorFlow, the user first defines a computation graph (a symbolic representation of the computation), and then examples are fed into an engine that executes this computation and computes its derivatives. In DyNet’s dynamic declaration strategy, computation graph construction is mostly transparent, being implicitly constructed by executing procedural code that computes the network outputs, and the user is free to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration thus facilitates the implementation of more complicated network architectures, and DyNet is specifically designed to allow users to implement their models in a way that is idiomatic in their preferred programming language (C++ or Python). One challenge with dynamic declaration is that because the symbolic computation graph is defined anew for every training example, its construction must have low overhead. To achieve this, DyNet has an optimized C++ backend and lightweight graph representation. Experiments show that DyNet’s speeds are faster than or comparable with static declaration toolkits, and significantly faster than Chainer, another dynamic declaration toolkit. DyNet is released open-source under the Apache 2.0 license.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">arXiv</abbr> </div> <div id="Swayamdipta:17" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09528" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Frame-Semantic Parsing with Softmax-Margin Segmental RNNs and a Syntactic Scaffold</b></a></div> <div class="author"> <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Sam Thomson , Chris Dyer , and Noah A.

Built using an extension to the segmental RNN that emphasizes recall, our basic system achieves competitive performance without any calls to a syntactic parser. We then introduce a method that uses phrase-syntactic annotations from the Penn Treebank during training only, through a multitask objective; no parsing is required at training or test time. This "syntactic scaffold" offers a cheaper alternative to traditional syntactic pipelining, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">CoNLL</abbr> </div> <div id="Swayamdipta:16" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"><a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K16-1019" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener"><b>Greedy, Joint Syntactic-Semantic Parsing with Stack LSTMs</b></a></div> <div class="author"> <span style="font-weight:bold">Swabha Swayamdipta</span>, Miguel Ballesteros , Chris Dyer , and Noah A.
